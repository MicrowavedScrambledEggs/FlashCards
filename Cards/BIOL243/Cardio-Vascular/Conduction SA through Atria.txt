Conduction: SA through Atria

0.05 m/s conduction inside SA Node. 4 m/s conduction through 
fibres in ventricle. 

Internodal atrial pathways (from SA node through atrium to AV 
node) has 1 m/s conduction. Makes both atria contract together.

Nonconductive fibrous ring between the atria and the ventricles
ensure that the only impulses from the atrium to the ventricle
are via the AV node.
