Cardiovascular System
Ectopic Beats

Ectopic foci or premature contractions are caused by:

 	(1) Local areas of ischemia
 	(2) Calcified plaques
 	(3) Toxic irritation of A-V node, Purkinje system or 
		myocardium by drugs like nicotine or caffeine

After an extra beat, the heart is refactory, so it takes extra
time before next contraction. This pause causes more blood to
flow into the heat before the next beat.
