Cardiovascular System
Stokes-Adams Syndrome

Complete A-V block comes and goes.

Ventricles stop contracting for 5-30 sec because of overdrive 
suppression meaning they are accustomed to an atrial drive.

Patient faints because of poor cerebral blood flow.

Then, ventricular escape occurs with A-V nodal or A-V bundle 
rhythm (15-40 beats /min). 

Ventricular pacemakers are given to these patients.
