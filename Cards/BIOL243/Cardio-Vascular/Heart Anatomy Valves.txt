Heart Anatomy: Valves

Atrial-ventricular valves (AV) control the flow of blood from 
the atrium to the ventricle. Cordae tendinae
try prevent eversion of valves. Cordae tendinae controlled by
papillary muscles that contract with the wall of the ventricle.

Aortic valves: Tough valves as higher pressure.  

Heart murmors can be from faulty valves causing regurgitation,
with blood flowing back from ventricle to atrium

Valves work with pressure. When atrium pressure higher than 
ventricle, AV valves open. When ventrilcle contracts, AV valves
close and aortic valves open, as pressure in the ventricle is
higher.

Aortic valves are strong so dont need cordae tendinae
