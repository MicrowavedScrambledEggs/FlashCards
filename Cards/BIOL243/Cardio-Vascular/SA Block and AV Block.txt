Cardiovascular System
SA Block and AV Block

Automaticity in nodes are same but impulses from them are 
blocked. Can be caused by Ischemia, scar tissue from an 
infarct (tissue death), or excessive vagal stimulation 

SA Block: No P waves. AV node takes over as pacemaker. Slower
and more erratic heart rate

AV Block: Impulses slowed through AV node and AV bundle. Can 
also be caused by A-V nodal or A-V bundle inflammation.

1st degree – prolonged PR interval (> 0.2 sec)

2nd degree – intermittent e.g 2:1 or 3:1, etc (Occasional QRS 
wave blocked)

3rd degree – complete block with ‘ventricular escape’
P waves are completely dissociated from QRST. Ventricle beat at
the automaticity of its own pace maker (bundle of his)
