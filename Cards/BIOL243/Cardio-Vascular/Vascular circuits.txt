Cardiovascular System
Vascular circuits

Pulmonary. To and from lungs. Right ventricle. 
Low pressure 15-30 mm Hg. Vascular resistance to flow low.

Systemic. To and from rest of body. Left ventricle. High 
pressure 100-140 mm Hg. Organs' and tissues' capillary beds are
connected in parallel to exercise control of blood flow to 
specific organs. 

Both circuits' flow need to be equal to each other as closed 
system. 

.
Q symbol for flow/quantity per minute. ~5 L per min resting.
~25 L/min when physically active.
