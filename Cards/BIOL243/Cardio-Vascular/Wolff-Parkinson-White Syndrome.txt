Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome

Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia

An extra connection or accessory pathway (short-circuit) that 
allows electrical signals to bypass the atrioventricular node 
and move from the atria to the ventricles faster than usual. 
Impulses may also be transmitted from the ventricles back to the 
atria.

Could be caused by damage to the septal area.

Reduces efficiency by causing ventricle to contract before
atrium.
