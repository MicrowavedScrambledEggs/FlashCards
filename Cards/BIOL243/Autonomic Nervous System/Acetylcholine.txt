BIOL243
Autonomic Nervous System
Acetylcholine

Neurotranmitter in brain and neurotransmitter for motor neurons.
Binds to nicotinic receptors in ganglia to trigger firing of 
postganglionic neuron. Also binds to muscarinic receptors in
the parasympathetic nervous system

Inhibiting acetycholine-estorase, which degrades acetylcholine,
causes muscle tremors as muscles get over stimulated.
