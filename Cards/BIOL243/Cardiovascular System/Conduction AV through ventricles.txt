Conduction: AV through ventricles

Need a moment in between atria contracting and ventricles 
contracting to give time for blood to flow from the atria to 
the ventricles. Decremental conduction in nodal region of AV 
node. 0.1 s delay before impulse reaches the purkinje fibres.

AV node has 
 - Nodal region
 - Bundle of His, which has automaticity

Purkinje fibers have left and right branches for each ventricle.
Purkinje fibers are posisioned such that the impulse through 
them causes the ventricles to 'wring out' all the blood in them.
