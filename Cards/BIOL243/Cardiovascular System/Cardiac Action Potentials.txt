Cardiac Action Potentials

A bit of a delay between the bump in action potential and bump
in muscle tension. 

Fast responce fibers.

Potential difference: resting -80 mv

Refractory period 200-250ms, 50x longer than skeletal muscles,
to prevent other action potentials occuring. Starts with spike
caused by sodium channels opening. Plateau that drags out 
refractory period maintained by calcium channels. Ends with 
calcium channels closing and potasium channels opening, taking
it back to resting potential. 

Slow Response fibers:

Resting potential gradually increase untill threshold reached
(from ~-55 mV to ~-35 mV). Then spike happens.
