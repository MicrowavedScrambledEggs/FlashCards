Automaticity

Heart cells can beat on their own (automaticity). Connected 
cells beat at the rate of the cell with the fastest automaticity

SA node has fastest automaticity of the heart (~100 bpm). 
Hormone control etc stops the heart going at SA nodes rate all 
the time. 

AV node is next (40-60 bpm). This means it will take over if
something wrong with SA node

Ectopic focus is when another region of the heart beats faster 
than the the pacemaker (SA node), therfore taking over control
of heart rate and increasing it. Can be caused by drugs.
